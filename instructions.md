## Concatenation Check

### Directions

- Create a new folder on your workstation desktop named: **concat-check**
- Add a file (`concat_mc.py`) to the folder
- Add a comment block to the top of your Python file (name, date, *Concatenation Check* as the project title)  


### Finished?

- Show your teacher your `concat_mc.py` script today during Teacher Time


### Your Tasks

- Use a comment to label each task in your script
- For example: `# Task 1`, `# Task 2`, etc.
- Pay attention to spelling, grammar, and capitalization!

### Task 1
- Define two (2) string variables
- Assign your first name to the first variable
- Assign your favorite junk food, movie or game to the second variable
- Use **concatenation** to build and display a string that displays both your name and your favorite junk food, movie or game


### Task 2

- Use the `print( )` function three times to tell me what you've learned about concatenation
- **Do not use variables for this task**
- Just print each string you create directly
- String #1 should say: What I've learned about concatenation:
- String # 2 should tell me one thing you've learned about concatenation
- String # 3 should tell me a second thing you've learned about concatenation

### Task 3

- Define a variable that stores the price of an item at Burger King
- Assign the item price **as a number** to your variable
  
- Use **concatenation** to build and display a string that contains (a) the item name and (b) the item price
    - Example: At Burger King, a Whopper with cheese costs $5.99.
- Remember to include the dollar sign ($) in your output string
